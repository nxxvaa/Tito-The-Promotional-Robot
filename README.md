# ü§ñ Tito: The Open-Source Promotional Robot

> Innovation is meant to be shared ‚Äî not stolen.

Tito is a mobile promotional robot designed for events, exhibitions, and interactive product showcases. Originally created by me, the design was unfortunately used without permission by a commercial entity. As a response, I‚Äôm making **Tito fully open-source** so anyone can build, modify, and deploy it freely.

## üöÄ What is Tito?

**Tito** is an autonomous, four-wheeled robot that uses:
- **Ultrasonic sensors** for real-time obstacle avoidance
- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** to generate maps of indoor spaces
- A **Raspberry Pi** for onboard control
- **Hoverboard motors** salvaged from standard boards for mobility and torque

Whether you‚Äôre showcasing products or demonstrating robotics, Tito makes your work stand out ‚Äî literally and technically.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Assemble the Chassis
- Mount the hoverboard wheels to a custom or metal frame.
- Secure the Pi, battery, and electronics.

### 2. Wire Up Components
- Connect ultrasonic sensors to GPIO pins.
- Connect ESCs to Pi and power distribution system.

### 3. Recommendations

‚Ä¢ I DO NOT RECOMMEND using 3D Printed Material in this project. You should us plastic or
fiber glass and there are multiple manufacturers in Egypt.
‚Ä¢ Aluminum for the profiles would be light weight and suitable.
‚Ä¢ I DO NOT RECOMMEND skipping steps or changing the steps order each step is important to
be taken one at a time.
‚Ä¢ Each step reveals a new modification in the design and the internal structure so be patient.
‚Ä¢ You have to be flexible with components but never compensate in the material or the
structure.
‚Ä¢ The design needs modifications for Neon Inserts and air cooling.
‚Ä¢ The use of a fan for cooling should be studied.
‚Ä¢ The timeline is always flexible.
‚Ä¢ Modify the wheel plates for the project.
‚Ä¢ Try to create new supports for body fixation with the robot.
‚Ä¢ Make space for the cooling fans.

### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install rpi.gpio numpy
# For SLAM:
# sudo apt install ros-<distro>-gmapping (if using ROS)
