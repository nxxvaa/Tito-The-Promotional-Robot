# 🤖 Tito: The Open-Source Promotional Robot

> Innovation is meant to be shared — not stolen.

Tito is a mobile promotional robot designed for events, exhibitions, and interactive product showcases. Originally created by me, the design was unfortunately used without permission by a commercial entity. As a response, I’m making **Tito fully open-source** so anyone can build, modify, and deploy it freely. (Please Note that I made this while I was graduating so excuse the mess :) )

## 🚀 What is Tito?

**Tito** is an autonomous, four-wheeled robot that uses:
- **Ultrasonic sensors** for real-time obstacle avoidance
- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** to generate maps of indoor spaces
- A **Raspberry Pi** for onboard control
- **Hoverboard motors** salvaged from standard boards for mobility and torque

Whether you’re showcasing products or demonstrating robotics, Tito makes your work stand out — literally and technically.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Assemble the Chassis
- Mount the hoverboard wheels to a custom or metal frame.
- Secure the Pi, battery, and electronics.

### 2. Wire Up Components
- Connect ultrasonic sensors to GPIO pins.
- Connect ESCs to Pi and power distribution system.

### 3. Recommendations

- I DO NOT RECOMMEND using 3D Printed Material in this project. You should us plastic or fiber glass and there are multiple manufacturers in Egypt.
- Aluminum for the profiles would be light weight and suitable.
- I DO NOT RECOMMEND skipping steps or changing the steps order each step is important to be taken one at a time.
- Each step reveals a new modification in the design and the internal structure so be patient.
- You have to be flexible with components but never compensate in the material or the structure.
- The design needs modifications for Neon Inserts and air cooling.
- The use of a fan for cooling should be studied.
- The timeline is always flexible.
- Modify the wheel plates for the project.
- Try to create new supports for body fixation with the robot.
- Make space for the cooling fans.
